            <h2>Master Teacher Dray Scott</h2>
            <h4>Supplying Identity and Purpose Based Solutions to Maximize Succes in your Professional and Personal Life</h4>
            <p>I help individuals connect to their purpose by teaching them how to developer the power of Self awareness and Self Identification. Whether you are a corporation or an individual your lasting value is only as great as your own self Portrait.</p>
            <p>Regardless to the roles one plays in life each person has a core being that is essentially who they are. I will teach you how to connect to that cor being and how to live from that core to generate the power to achieve high levels of success. You don't have to loose your self, but you can be yourself in anything you do as a leader, coach, manager, etc. People are more apt to follow a leader who is comfortable in their own skin as well as one who has the knowledge of what to do.</p>
            <p>Rather I'm speaking to a group or one on one, to a student, parent, coaach, pastor, athlete or entertainer the message is always clear. Know yourself so you can be yourself... to the fullest.</p>
            <p>In my book "What is Man?", I present a comprehensive program that equipms you with fundamental principles that allows you to connect to your core self, recognize and reconnect when you are disconnected, and help your network to do the same.</p>
